# Hi, I'm Sharan 👋

I'm a passionate Software Developer with a B.E in Computer Science and Engineering. I love building clean, functional, and scalable applications that solve real-world problems. I specialize in full-stack Python development and enjoy working with modern frameworks and tools to bring ideas to life. Whether it's developing robust APIs, crafting responsive frontends, or deploying scalable systems to the cloud, I strive for simplicity, performance, and maintainability in every project. Outside of my main work, I also enjoy freelancing and collaborating on meaningful software solutions.
